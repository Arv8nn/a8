> [!note]
>Wait for the Yonggekk script to install the Singh Box in the Yonggekk script to list the IP scripts, then use the given IPs that are required during the installation phase. In the next stages, the Enter will be set by default.
Use the same script to delete any script you install to receive configuration.

# socks5

https://github.com/cmliu/socks5-for-serv00

To use the Socks5, first log in to Devilweb WebPanel and create a TCP port with a value of 60000-1025 in the Port Reservation section, then run the Serv00 Socks5 script.

The site does not support more than 3 open ports. So you can customize a UDP port to use the Socks5 next to the configures.

# MTproxy

To use the telegram proxy, first log in to Devilweb WebPanel and create a TCP port with a value of 60000-1025 in the Port Reservation section, then run the Serv00 MTProxy script.

The site does not support more than 3 open ports. So you can customize a UDP to use the telegram proxy alongside the configurations.
