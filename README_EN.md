- ## socks5

https://github.com/cmliu/socks5-for-serv00
> [!note]
>To use the Socks5, first log in to Devilweb WebPanel and create a TCP port with a value of 1025-60000 in the Port Reservation section, then run the Serv00 Socks5 script.

> [!important] 
**The site does not support more than 3 open ports. So you can remove a UDP port to use the Socks5 next to the sing-box configures.**

- ## MTproxy
> [!note]
>To use the telegram proxy, first log in to Devilweb WebPanel and create a TCP port with a value of 1025-60000 in the Port Reservation section, then run the Serv00 MTProxy script.
